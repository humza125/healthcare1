    <h1>General Checkup</h1>
    <p>
      Our General Checkup service is designed to provide a thorough and holistic assessment of your overall health. During your visit, our experienced physicians will conduct a detailed review of your medical history, including any previous illnesses, surgeries, medications, and family health patterns. The checkup begins with a comprehensive physical examination, where vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature are measured. We also assess your body mass index (BMI) and perform a head-to-toe evaluation to detect any early signs of disease.
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of the checkup, we offer a range of laboratory investigations, including complete blood count, blood sugar, cholesterol profile, liver and kidney function tests, and urinalysis. These tests help in identifying common chronic conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and high cholesterol at an early stage. Our team also screens for lifestyle-related risk factors and provides personalized advice on nutrition, exercise, stress management, and preventive care. For women, we offer additional screenings such as breast examination and Pap smear, while men may receive prostate health assessments.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the examination and test results, our doctors discuss your health status in detail, answer your questions, and provide a tailored health plan. We emphasize preventive healthcare and encourage regular follow-ups to monitor your progress. If any abnormalities are detected, we coordinate referrals to relevant specialists for further evaluation and management. Our goal is to empower you with knowledge about your health and support you in making informed decisions for a healthier future.
