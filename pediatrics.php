    <h1>Pediatrics</h1>
    <p>
      The Pediatrics department at Health Care is committed to delivering comprehensive medical services for children from birth through adolescence. Our pediatricians are skilled in managing a wide spectrum of childhood health issues, from routine wellness checks to complex medical conditions. We provide newborn care, including initial screenings and guidance for new parents, and continue to monitor growth and development milestones throughout childhood. Our immunization program follows the latest national and international guidelines to protect children from preventable diseases.
    </p>
    <p>
      We diagnose and treat acute illnesses such as infections, fevers, and respiratory problems, as well as chronic conditions like asthma, allergies, and diabetes. Our team works closely with families to address nutritional needs, offering advice on breastfeeding, weaning, and balanced diets for different age groups. We also provide behavioral and developmental assessments, helping to identify and manage issues such as ADHD, learning difficulties, and emotional challenges. For adolescents, we offer counseling on puberty, mental health, and preventive care, ensuring a smooth transition into adulthood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our child-friendly environment is designed to reduce anxiety and make visits comfortable for both children and parents. We believe in family-centered care, involving parents in every step of the decision-making process. Our pediatricians collaborate with specialists in other fields when needed, ensuring that every child receives the best possible care tailored to their unique needs.
